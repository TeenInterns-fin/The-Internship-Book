# Theme Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Default Theme Changed to Dark Mode
**Problem:** Website was defaulting to light mode instead of dark mode
**Solution:** Updated all HTML files and theme toggle JavaScript

**Files Modified:**
- `theme-toggle.js` - Changed default theme from 'light' to 'dark'
- `index.html` - Changed `<body data-theme="light">` to `<body data-theme="dark">`
- `team.html` - Changed `<body data-theme="light">` to `<body data-theme="dark">`
- `preorder.html` - Changed `<body data-theme="light">` to `<body data-theme="dark">`
- `qr-generator.html` - Already had `data-theme="dark"` ✓

### 2. Footer Logo Visibility Fixed
**Problem:** Footer logo text "The Internship Book" was not visible in any theme because footer has dark background
**Solution:** Added specific CSS rules to make footer logo text white and visible

**Files Modified:**
- `styles-footer-responsive.css` - Added footer logo visibility rules:
  ```css
  /* Ensure footer logo text is always visible in dark footer */
  .footer-logo-img,
  .footer-logo .logo-text {
      color: #FFFFFF !important;
      -webkit-text-fill-color: #FFFFFF !important;
      background: none !important;
      background-image: none !important;
      -webkit-background-clip: initial !important;
      background-clip: initial !important;
      text-decoration: none;
  }

  /* Footer logo should be white, not teal */
  .footer-brand .logo-text {
      color: #FFFFFF !important;
      -webkit-text-fill-color: #FFFFFF !important;
  }
  ```

## Changes Made:

### theme-toggle.js
```javascript
// Before:
const savedTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme') || 'light';

// After:
const savedTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme') || 'dark';
```

### HTML Files
All HTML files now start with dark theme:
```html
<body class="loading" data-theme="dark">
```

### Footer Logo CSS
Added comprehensive footer logo styling to ensure visibility in the dark footer background across all pages.

## Testing Checklist:

- ✅ Website now loads in dark mode by default
- ✅ Footer logo "The Internship Book" is visible on all pages
- ✅ Theme toggle still works properly (can switch between light and dark)
- ✅ Footer logo appears white on dark footer background
- ✅ Main navigation logo still appears in teal color as intended
- ✅ All pages (index.html, team.html, preorder.html, qr-generator.html) use dark theme by default

## Result:
- **Default Theme:** Now starts in dark mode as requested
- **Footer Logo:** Now visible on all pages with white text on dark footer
- **Theme Toggle:** Still functions normally for users who want to switch themes
- **Brand Consistency:** Header logo remains teal, footer logo is white for visibility
